 3. INSIGHTS:

 • Customers between the ages of 30 and 50 respond to campaigns the best.
 • Term deposit subscription rates are higher among married and educated people.
 • Compared to customers with low or extremely high balances, those with medium account balances convert more successfully.
 • The success of the current campaign is strongly positively impacted by prior campaign contact.
 • Response is highly influenced by the month of contact; May and August saw the highest levels of engagement.
 • As a sign of risk aversion, loan holders are less likely to sign up for new term deposits.
